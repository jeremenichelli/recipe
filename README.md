Boilerplate repository to build ES2015 JavaScript modules. Built using Gulp as a task runner, ESLint for lint checking, Babel for transpelling, and Karma for unit tests.

Feel free to dig into it, propose changes or fork and use it. Tovers the most primitive needs for an elemental JavaScript project so there's a chance you might need to add new stuff to adapt it to your needs.
