# recipe [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeremenichelli/recipe.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jeremenichelli/recipe)
Starter Kit for script repositories using Gulp work flow to check syntax, run tests and minify code.

Feel free to dig into it, propose changes or fork and use it. Take in account that this covers the most primitive needs for a normal JavaScript project so there's a chance you might need to add new stuff to adapt your needs.

*Remember to do ```npm install``` on your folder to get all the packages required to run tasks.*


### Check syntax

```
gulp hint
```

### Run tests

```
gulp test
```

### Run all tasks and build to generate minified code

```
gulp
```
